# Explanatory Data Analysis - Terrorism

## Project Description
This project aims at performing an explanatory data analysis on a global terrorism dataset. This project was a part of a one-month Data Science & Business Analytics online internship at The Sparks Foundation from Feb 2022 to Mar 2022. The tools used for the analysis:
- _**Excel**_: For exploring, modifying & asking questions about the data. 
- _**R**_: As the programming language used for the analysis.
- _**R studio**_: To write R codes in conjunction with HTML & CSS codes to produce an HTML report.
- _**Power BI**_: was used to create an informative & interactive dashboard.
 
## About the Data
The dataset contains crimes that took place from 1970 to 2017 all over the world. It consists of 181,691 rows and 135 columns in an Xlsx file.

## Project Process
First, we explored the data to get an overview of the variables and records and get a solid understanding of the data. Then, Some modifications to the data were performed like dropping the columns that aren't relevant to our analysis. Then, We imported the Xlsx file to the R Studio environment to write R codes to manipulate and analyze our data in addition to HTML & CSS codes in order to produce a compelling and readable report in the form of an HTML file. Finally, we visualized the cleaned dataset by creating an informative & interactive three-page dashboard using Power BI.

## Exploring the Analysis Results
To investigate the results of the analysis, download and open the "Task_2-Terrorism.html" file. You can check the code written in the "Task_2-Terrorism.Rmd" file. 

Visit: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494 and check the system requirements, then install the Power BI application to explore the dashboard.

To view the dashboard, you can download the "Task 2 - Terrorism.pbix" file and the Excel file in "terrorism dataset.rar". Extract the Excel file then, open the pbix file using Power BI and from the Home tab, click on the arrow below "Transform data" and click on "Change data source" and select the path to the extracted Excel file.
